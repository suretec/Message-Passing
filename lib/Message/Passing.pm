=head1 NAME

Message::Passing - a simple way of doing messaging.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    message-pass --input STDIN --output STDOUT
    {"foo": "bar"}
    {"foo":"bar"}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A library for building high performance, loosely coupled and reliable/resilient applications,
structured as small services which communicate over the network by passing messages.

=head2 BASIC PREMISE

You have data for discrete events, represented by a hash (and
serialized as JSON).

This could be a text log line, an audit record of an API
event, a metric emitted from your application that you wish
to aggregate and process - anything that can be a simple hash really..

You want to be able to shove these events over the network easily,
and aggregate them / filter and rewrite them / split them into worker queues.

This module is designed as a simple framework for writing components
that let you do all of these things, in a simple and easily extensible
manor.

For a practical example, You generate events from a source (e.g.
L<ZeroMQ> output of logs and performance metrics from your L<Catalyst> FCGI
or L<Starman> workers) and run one script that will give you a central
application log file, or push the logs into Elasticsearch.

There are a growing set of components you can plug together
to make your solution.

Getting started is really easy - you can just use the C<message-pass>
command installed by the distribution. If you have a common config
that you want to repeat, or you want to write your own server
which does something more flexible than the normal script allows,
then see L<Message::Passing::DSL>.

To dive straight in, see the documentation for the command line utility
L<message-pass>, and see the examples in L<Message::Passing::Manual::Cookbook>.

For more about how the system works, see L<Message::Passing::Manual::Concepts>.

=head1 COMPONENTS

Below is a non-exhaustive list of components available.

=head2 INPUTS

Inputs receive data from a source (usually a network protocol).

They are responsible for decoding the data into a hash before passing
it onto the next stage.

Inputs include:

=over

=item L<Message::Passing::Input::STDIN>

=item L<Message::Passing::Input::ZeroMQ>

=item L<Message::Passing::Input::STOMP>

=item L<Message::Passing::Input::AMQP>

=item L<Message::Passing::Input::Syslog>

=item L<Message::Passing::Input::Redis>

=item L<Message::Passing::Input::Test>

=back

You can easily write your own input, just use L<AnyEvent>, and
consume L<Message::Passing::Role::Input>.

=head2 FILTER

Filters can transform a message in any way.

Examples include:

=over

=item L<Message::Passing::Filter::Null> - Returns the input unchanged.

=item L<Message::Passing::Filter::All> - Stops any messages it receives from being passed to the output. I.e. literally filters all input out.

=item L<Message::Passing::Filter::T> - Splits the incoming message to multiple outputs.

=back

You can easily write your own filter, just consume
L<Message::Passing::Role::Filter>.

Note that filters can be chained, and a filter can return undef to
stop a message being passed to the output.

=head2 OUTPUTS

Outputs send data to somewhere, i.e. they consume messages.

=over

=item L<Message::Passing::Output::STDOUT>

=item L<Message::Passing::Output::AMQP>

=item L<Message::Passing::Output::STOMP>

=item L<Message::Passing::Output::ZeroMQ>

=item L<Message::Passing::Output::WebHooks>

=item L<Message::Passing::Output::Search::Elasticsearch>

=item L<Message::Passing::Output::Redis>

=item L<Message::Passing::Output::Test>

=back

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over

=item L<Message::Passing::Manual> - The manual (contributions cherished).

=item L<http://www.slideshare.net/bobtfish/messaging-interoperability-and-log-aggregation-a-new-framework> - Slide deck!

=item L<Log::Message::Structured> - For creating your log messages.

=item L<Log::Dispatch::Message::Passing> - use Message::Passing outputs from L<Log::Dispatch>.

=back

=head1 THIS MODULE

This is a simple L<MooX::Options> script, with one input, one filter
and one output. To build your own similar scripts, see:

=over

=item L<Message::Passing::DSL> - To declare your message chains.

=item L<Message::Passing::Role::CLIComponent> - To provide C<foo> and C<foo_options> attribute pairs.

=item L<Message::Passing::Role::Script> - To provide daemonization features.

=back

=head2 METHODS

=head3 build_chain

Builds and returns the configured chain of input => filter => output.

=head3 start

Class method to call the run_message_server function with the results of
having constructed an instance of this class, parsed command line options
and constructed a chain.

This is the entry point for the script.
